# Sentiment-Analysis-of-Product-Reviews-Across-Domains
### About the Project
- Rapid expansion in all fields, such as manufacturing, entertainment, and IT industries, is occurring in today's globe; as a result, all fields must improve the characteristics of their products to compete in the cutthroat competition. As a result, industries must rely on vast amounts of web data about their products from social media sites and online comments to determine where improvements should be made or where any other flaws should be addressed. 
- `Sentiment Analysis` is the process of extracting and categorizing data to determine whether a text or sentence is positive or negative. In today’s world, there are lumps of product reviews and feedback being collected from the customers. The companies must analyze the information regarding their products and assess their product quality and customer satisfaction. This helps the companies make the right decisions, thus improving customer service and product satisfaction.
- In this project, we will be performing a sentiment analysis on product reviews, across all domains, in turn helping brands from a wide range address their customers' problems in specific, using powerful ML models.
